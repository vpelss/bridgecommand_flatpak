      Bridge Command is a free interactive ship simulator program for Windows, Apple OSX and Linux. Its aim is to be a training tool for navigation, radar, ship handling, and other seamanship skills. Bridge Command released under the General Public Licence v2, and is available for commercial and non-commercial use.

      Bridge Command is very highly flexible, with the environmental model, ships, buoys, individual scenarios and almost all aspects of the simulation being configurable to your own needs. Bridge Command can be run on a single computer, with no additional devices needed. It can also be run with physical controls, and has an interface where a trainer can control scenarios in order to carry out training exercises, from a second computer. It can display on a single screen, or can display a full panoramic view across multiple screens using multiple computers. The radar picture is simulated in real-time, and includes standard marine radar controls such as gain and clutter, as well as features such as parallel indexes and ARPA contact tracking.
